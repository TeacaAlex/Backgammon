  Backgammon

  Requirements
    This project was tested on Ubuntu 12.10.

      -to run spell Backgammon you need JRE
        sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
      -to compile java sources you need JDK
        sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk

  Getting Started
    To get started with Backgammon, you'll need to get familiar with Git.

    To initialize your local repository using the Backgammon trees, use a command like this:
          $ git clone https://github.com/TeacaAlex/Backgammon.git
    Then:
          $ cd Backgammon/src/
          $ make
            open another terminal
            $ java -jar server.jar
          $ make run

    The sintax for runninh server.jar is: java -jar server.jar 7777 100, where:
        7777 = port to listen. Default port is 6666
        100  = timeout

    "make run" calls : java ClientStub 127.0.0.1 6666 7 7, where:
        127.0.0.1 = local host
        6666 = port to connect
        7 = level. You can choose: 1, 5, 7, 8.

  Results
    Level 5: 70/100 victories
    Level 7: 60-65 victories

  Implementation
    -using a minimax approach, I implemented AlphaBetaPruning on 3 levels with 4 types of
    nodes (one for min and max, and two nodes chance for each player) to choose the good move;
    -in leaf nodes, max choose the best evaluated board with Evaluare, then choose min
    worst board until it reaches the parent node of simulation;
    -with the move returned by alphabeta, i update the board and send to the
    server my move;
    - for better results can improve the function that evaluate the board;
